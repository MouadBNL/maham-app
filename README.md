Simple todo app focused on the User experience, offline access and speed.


## Tasks

## Tech stack 

- Vite with react.
- TanStack router because it looks interesting.
- Tailwind and shadcn for the UI.
- Dexie db for local data mangement, and in the future build the sync layer.

currently in the process of refactoring things a bit
- usage of repository to call the data layer
- too much copy past between project and inbox refactoring that into something more DRY
- creating service later with react-query and mutation
